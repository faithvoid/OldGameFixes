This is a repository containing multiple fixes for multiple retro games (around 2004 and older) to get them working in the best state they can on newer hardware.

Game patches currently hosted:
- Max Payne: AMD Ryzen "JPEG Error" Fix
- The Longest Journey: Font Patch (Steam) - Recommended to use in conjunction with ScummVM for compatibility.
- Syberia & Post Mortem (and other Microids games): Intro skip files + black screen fix (pre-configured "player.ini" file) - use macOS version in ScummVM for best compatibility (instructions in folder).
