This is a repository containing multiple fixes for multiple retro games (around 2004 and older) to get them working in the best state they can on newer hardware.

Game patches currently hosted:
- Max Payne: AMD Ryzen "JPEG Error" Fix
- The Longest Journey: Font Patch (Steam-specific, as GOG & retail comes with the correct fonts.) [RECOMMEND PLAYING WITH SCUMMVM] 
- Syberia & Post Mortem (and other Microids games): Intro skip files + black screen fix (pre-configured "player.ini" file)
