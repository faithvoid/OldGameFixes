This is a pre-configured .ini file for both Syberia & Post Mortem (and other Microids games that use the same engine). 
Drag and drop "player.ini" into your Syberia or Post Mortem (or other Microids game) installation folder, and the games should launch in an 800x600 window (the max resolution for either of these games).

Or, if you'd rather manually make a player.ini file, insert this line into it:

800 600 32 0 BaseCMO.cmo

You can additionally change the "0" in the above line to a "1" to run the game in full-screen mode.

Additionally included are intro skip files for each game. Download "intro_Microids.par" for Post Mortem or "intro_Microids.syb" for Syberia and replace them in your game's "Video" directory.

To play the Steam version of Syberia using ScummVM 2.8.0 (earlier builds won't work, and only the macOS version of Syberia works as it uses the Tetraedge engine), do the following:

Enter this link into your browser: steam://open/console

Once the Steam Console opens, type in the following:

@sSteamCmdForcePlatformType macos
@sSteamCmdForcePlatformBitness 32

Now download (if you already have the game installed, uninstall it) Syberia, and once it's done, right click it, select "Manage", and go to "Browse Local Files"

Copy the Contents folder inside "Syberia.app" somewhere safe and rename the Contents folder to "Syberia". Point ScummVM at this new "Syberia" folder and it should detect and launch the game without any issues.
