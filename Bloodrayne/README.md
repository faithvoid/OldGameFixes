To fix issues with cutscenes going too fast in the Steam version, download Bloodrayne: Terminal Cut (comes free with the original version) alongside the original Bloodrayne, right click the game and select Manage -> Browse Local Files, go into "Legacy Version", copy "rayne.exe" and paste it into your original Bloodrayne folder, overwriting the existing "rayne.exe". This .exe locks cutscenes at 30FPS and the rest of the game runs uncapped.

"But why not just play Terminal Cut?"

It's 14GB, which is a lot for a game that originally came out in 2001, especially if you're using a device with limited space like a 64GB Steam Deck. By using the Terminal Cut Legacy Version .exe, you can fix the framerate issues of the original Bloodrayne release.
